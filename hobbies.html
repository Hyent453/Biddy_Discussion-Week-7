      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Outside of work, I find joy in a few soulful hobbies. I love diving into biographies of inspiring medical figures—there’s always something to learn from those who walked this path before me. I’m also an avid fan of health podcasts; they spark new ideas and help me stay connected to the broader healthcare world.</p>

      <h2>My Reset Time</h2>
      <p>When I need to reset, I step into nature. A peaceful walk, the rustle of trees, and quiet moments in meditation do wonders for my well-being. These activities keep me grounded and remind me why I chose this path.</p>

      <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
      <p>One of my biggest inspirations is Florence Nightingale—her courage and tireless service during a time of war continue to light my path. Modern-day nurses who advocate for underserved communities also fuel my motivation daily.</p>
