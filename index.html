        <h3>Symbol of Hope</h3>
        <p>The butterfly is more than a beautiful creature—it's a symbol of transformation and gentle strength. Much like a nurse, it brings comfort and color to the lives it touches. This image represents my commitment to care with both science and soul.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare Is Personal</h3>
        <p>Every patient has a story. As a caregiver, I value listening deeply, advocating quietly, and caring wholeheartedly. The art of nursing is woven with moments of stillness, reassurance, and dignity.</p>
